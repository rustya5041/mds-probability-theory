    "- Net profit with the insurance will be decreased by the constant value of 30m in either situation of success or failure (damage costs are mitigated during failure per the assignment condition). \n",
    "- The expected profit with insurance is lower by 10m compared to the expected profit when the insuarance is not bought. Despite that, the squared error loss is 9 times lower when the insurance is bought, which allows for more damage control.\n",
    "- If the company is risk-averse and is interested in damage mitigation (and is not solely profit-oriented), then insurance guarantees that the failure lossess will be less damaging. In the **short-run**, the company can be better off by purchasing the insurance, as companies typically do not possess infinite resources; even two consecutive failures may permanently bankrupt the company. In the **long-run**, however, given that probabilities do not change, there's a different picture: if we simulate 1000 rocket launches, and assume 900 of them were successful, the company's expected profit is $\\mathbb{E}X = (900 * 100000000) + (100 * -200000000) = 70$ billion$, compared to $60$ billion$ when the insurance is bought. So, as number of launches $n$ grows, the company may obstain from buying the insurance. Moreover, real world companies tend to learn from their mistakes $\\implies$ the probability of failure $P(fail)$ is expected be lower after some arbitrarily large $n$.\n",

    "$\\therefore$ company can decide to purchase the insurance if it is 1) new, and plans to remain operational in the long-run,  2) is resource-limited, 3) underestimates the probability of failure and $P(fail)$ can increase 4) is not solely profit-oriented ($70$ vs $60$ is not such a trade-off after all). However, as I describe above, with the growing number of launches and company maturity there's typically less need for insurance.\n",
