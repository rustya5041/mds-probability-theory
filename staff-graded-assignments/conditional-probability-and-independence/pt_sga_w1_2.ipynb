    "`Answer`: by definition of the game restriction, the host always opens the non-chosen empty door. This gives us the information that under the general setup $1/2$ of the total decoy doors are eliminated by the host. Since we chose door $1$, which is empty, we eliminated the possibility of the host opening this door. Likewise, the host won't open the door $3$ since there's a car behind it. Using the _law of total probability_, we obtain the following setup for $P(A)$ calculation:\n",
    "- $P(A \\mid H{_1}) = {1 \\over 2}$, as the participant correctly guessed the car door, the host can open any remaining decoy doors $2$ or $3$ (assuming the host chooses randomly with equal probabilities)\n",
    "- $P(A \\mid H{_2}) = 0$, since the car is behind door $2$, which cannot be opened by the game restriction.\n",

    "Non-switching strategy results in $P(win) = {1 \\over 3}$, while switching allows to obtain $P(win) = {2 \\over 3},$ which is confirmed by the calculations above. Although being a bit complex, the same conclusion can be drawn if we brute force the solution using the backward induction. The participant wins by switching doors $\\iff$ the wrong door is chosen initially, which happens in $2 \\over 3$ cases.\n"
