asynchronous layered coding alc is an internet protocol for content delivery in a reliable massively scalable multiplerate and congestioncontrolled manner  specified in rfc  it is an ietf proposed standard
the protocol
is specifically designed to provide massive scalability using ip
multicast as the underlying network service  massive scalability in
this context means the number of concurrent receivers for an object
is potentially in the millions the aggregate size of objects to be
delivered in a session ranges from hundreds of kilobytes to hundreds
of gigabytes each receiver can initiate reception of an object
asynchronously the reception rate of each receiver in the session is
the maximum fair bandwidth available between that receiver and the
sender and all of this can be supported using a single sender
because alc is focused on reliable content delivery the goal is to
deliver objects as quickly as possible to each receiver while at the
same time remaining network friendly to competing traffic  thus the
congestion control used in conjunction with alc should strive to
maximize use of available bandwidth between receivers and the sender
while at the same time

the behavior of quantum dots qds in solution and their interaction with other surfaces is of great importance to biological and industrial applications such as optical displays animal tagging anticounterfeiting dyes and paints chemical sensing and fluorescent tagging however unmodified quantum dots tend to be hydrophobic which precludes their use in stable waterbased colloids furthermore because the ratio of surface area to volume in a quantum dot is much higher than for larger particles the thermodynamic free energy associated with dangling bonds on the surface is sufficient to impede the quantum confinement of excitons once solubilized by encapsulation in either a hydrophobic interior micelle or a hydrophilic exterior micelle the qds can be successfully introduced into an aqueous medium in which they form an extended hydrogel network in this form quantum dots can be utilized in several applications that benefit from their unique properties such as medical imaging and thermal destruction of malignant cancers

hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction hpv also known as the eulerliljestrand mechanism is a physiological phenomenon in which small pulmonary arteries constrict in the presence of alveolar hypoxia low oxygen levels by redirecting blood flow from poorlyventilated lung regions to wellventilated lung regions hpv is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying ventilationperfusion matching the process might initially seem counterintuitive as low oxygen levels might theoretically stimulate increased blood flow to the lungs to increase gas exchange however the purpose of hpv is to distribute bloodflow regionally to increase the overall efficiency of gas exchange between air and blood while the maintenance of ventilationperfusion ratio during regional obstruction of airflow is beneficial hpv can be detrimental during global alveolar hypoxia which occurs with exposure to high altitude where hpv causes a significant increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure potentially leading to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema several factors inhibit hpv including increased cardiac output hypocapnia hypothermia acidosisalkalosis increased

xuereb is a maltese surname
the xuereb surname is quoted by author charles a gauci in his book the genealogy and heraldry of the noble families of malta the author writes that the earliest references of this family go back to  with tommeo xuereb mentioned as nobile or noble
gauci gives us also the coat of arms of the family but tracing the origin of the name is very difficult even if we have some indication for the name to be of central european origin although it is not excluded that its origins are from spanish xueres or suarez or north african xwarib
the fact that the coat of arms shows two moors heads could also signify that the xuerebs distinguished themselves in the fighting against the muslims participating to the crusades this fact would give to this family a much earlier origin
